Nsibidi (also known as nsibiri, nchibiddi or nchibiddy) is an ancient system of graphic communication indigenous to the Ejagham peoples of southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon in the Cross River region. It is also used by neighboring Ibibio, Efik and Igbo peoples.

Nsibidi PictogramsÂ  have found their way into so many applications in modern typographic expressions, ranging from digital (Marvel with Black Panther and various logomarks), and print (as pattern on fabric, tattoos, logomarks) due to its nature as a pictographic script. 

The Nsibidi Libre typeface is a vehicle for cultural preservation, storytelling, and bridging the gap between ancient symbolic communication and modern typographic expression.
